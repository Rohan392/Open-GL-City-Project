## Project Overview

A 3D city simulation built with OpenGL that features interactive navigation, a controllable car, and a detailed environment. This project demonstrates object-oriented design, graphics programming, and real-time rendering principles. Multiple views showcase different computer graphics concepts. A randomizer was used to give the city a gothic design and make each building unique and wacky.

## Features

- **Fully Controllable Car:**  
  Animated wheels and physics-inspired movement.

- **Dynamic Camera System:**  
  Supports first-person and follow-cam modes, with collision-aware navigation.

- **Procedurally Generated City:**  
  A 10×10 city grid including roads, textured buildings, and traffic intersections.

## Technologies

- OpenGL  
- C++  
- GLUT/GLFW (for windowing and input)

---

## Controls

- Arrow Keys — Move  
- F1, F2, F3, F4 — Different viewing perspectives

## Running the Game

You will need **g++** to compile and run the game. If you want to run the tests, please install **Google Test (gtest)** on your system.

### Steps (run in your terminal/bash):

```bash
make     # Compile the project and generate the executable
./main.exe # Run the game
make clean # clears the executable files              
```
