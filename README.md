## Project Overview

A 3D city simulation built with OpenGL that features interactive navigation, a controllable car, and a detailed environment. This project demonstrates object-oriented design, graphics programming, and real-time rendering principles. Multiple views showcase different computer graphics concepts. A randomizer was used to give the city a gothic design and make each building unique and wacky.
