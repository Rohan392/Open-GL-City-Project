OpenGL City Simulation
Overview


A 3D city simulation built with OpenGL that features interactive navigation, a controllable car, and a detailed environment. This project demonstrates object-oriented design, graphics programming, and real-time rendering principles.

Features
- Fully controllable car with animated wheels and physics-inspired movement.
- Dynamic camera system supporting first-person and follow-cam modes, with collision-aware navigation.
- Procedurally generated 10Ã—10 city grid including roads, textured buildings, and traffic intersections.

Technologies
- OpenGL
- C++
- GLUT/GLFW for windowing and input
