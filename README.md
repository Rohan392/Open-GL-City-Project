Overview
A 3D city simulation built with OpenGL that features interactive navigation, a controllable car, and a detailed environment. This project demonstrates object-oriented design, graphics programming, and real-time rendering principles. There are multiple views that can be used to help show the different kinds Computer Graphics principals. We had used a randomizer to help give the city a gothic design and make each building unique and wacky.
